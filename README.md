# SwimApplication

For this project, I have created a swim application where swimmers can log their workout and keep track of their fitness goals. 
The application has two tables: session table and swimmer table with one-to-many relationship as a swimmer can have multiple sessions. 
The session includes information such as date, distance, duration, stroke type, and title. 
A swimmer can add their name, age, and gender. 
This application have a CRUD functionality to create, read, update, or delete a session or swimmer. 
In the future, I would be looking to create another table that stores a swimmers fastest or longest distance swim session and create a reward system when they achieve their newest best goal to keep them motivated and engaged with their fitness goals.
